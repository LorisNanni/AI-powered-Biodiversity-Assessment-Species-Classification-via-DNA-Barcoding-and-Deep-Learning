This script is a variant of the FCGR method, 
modified to produce RGB images of DNA sequences from FASTA files.

To test this method:
    - Change the `input_base` to the directory where your data are stored.
    - Change the `output_base` to specify where you want the images to be saved.
    - Set `k_values` to define the length of k-mers
